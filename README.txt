Let us say that you have the opportunity to choose between a number of different items.  Each item has a different weight and a different value.  You can only choose as many items as you can carry.  If you had all the item weights and values in a list, how would you choose the ones that would give you the most value?  This is a classic 0 1 knapsack problem.  It is very useful to solve because it has many different applications.  

		You are going on vacation and have a certain weight restrictrion on your bag.  
		Which souvenir will you choose to bring home?

		You won a free bag of groceries and, as you want to get the most monitary value possible.
		You must choose the most expensive items and not break the bag.

		Or, as the case may be, you are a drug pusher and want to maxamize your street value by 
		filling your mules' bags with the most dolls (the container of choice) possible.

Really, doesn't everyone have this problem.  The following is a solution to the 0 1 knapsack problem written in Clojure.
